    "Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems transcribe text contained in scanned images into digital text. Off-line handwriting recognition involves the automatic conversion of text in an image into letter codes which are usable within computer and text-processing applications. The data obtained by this form is regarded as a static representation of handwriting. Off-line handwriting recognition is comparatively difficult, as different people have different handwriting styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks are most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. In this notebook I am going to build a Model consists of several Neural Networks which is going to be trained on images of names and surnames, the dataset original resource is https://appen.com.\n",

    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of more than four hundred thousand handwritten names collected through charity projects to support disadvantaged children around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character Recognition utilizes image processing technologies to convert characters on scanned documents into digital forms. It typically performs well in machine-printed fonts. However, it still poses difficult challenges for machines to recognize handwritten characters, because of the huge variation in individual writing styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 206,799 first names and 207,024 surnames in total. The data was divided into a training set (331,059), testing set (41,382), and validation set (41,382) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data here are hundreds of thousands of images of handwritten names. In the Data, youâ€™ll find the transcribed images broken up into test, training, and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Lable follow the following naming format enabling you to extend the data set with your own data.\n",
